- The GCP ACE is not an easy exam it covers a lot of topics.
- The best way to prepare is by building a **mental model** of how these services and resources interact.
- Topics I found to be very prevalent on the exam.
    - Networking
        - VPNs, VPCs, CIDR  Firewalls
        - how to connect to networks 
    - IAM and resource organization
        - best practices
        - What role would you give to someone who.....
        - Using best practices how would you.....
    - Command Line
        - They will ask questions on cloud sdk commands
        - You need to know the most common commands and flags
- There are no coding questions on the exam.

- Google will ask you about best practices.
- They might give questions where all the answers work but there is a preferred way to do so.
- In general best practices often

    - Grant no more access than appropriate 
    - Lean on GCP managing your resources
    - Centralizing information, logs and billing
    - DevOps and automate everything you can
