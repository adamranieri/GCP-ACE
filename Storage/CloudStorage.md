# GCS Google Cloud Storage
- Primary service for storing files/**objects**
    - Analogous to S3 for AWS
- **Buckets** are a collection of objects
- Bucket names must be gloablly unique
- Files are private by default 
- To make files public you have to edit persmissions
    - add entity Group
    - name allUsers
- Many other services like AppEngine use GCS
- Buckets must be made for a geographic location
    - Multi-region
        - example United States
    - Dual-region
        - example Iowa and South Carolin
    - Region
        - Europe-north1
- Pick a location geographically near the resources that will be using itW
- Buckets locations cannot be edited once created.
    - To "edit" you should make a new bucket in the correct location
    
- Storage Classes
    - Buckets can be created for different storage accessiblity
    - Done to save money for less accessed files
    - All classes have a minium storage duration which is how long it must be in the bucket before being accessed *without* a cost penalty
    - All objects in storage are accessible in milleseconds *for a price*
    - In general you pay more for data transfer and less for data storage
    - Standard
        - For frequently updated/used
    - Nearline
        - Minimum duration 30 days
    - Coldline
        - Minimum duration  90 days
    - Archive
        - Minimum duration 365 days
